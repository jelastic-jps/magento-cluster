# Auto-Scalable Magento Cluster

Magento, PHP based eCommerce platform, is packaged as an advanced highly reliable and auto-scalable cluster on top of certified Jelastic dockerized stack templates with the following topology:

- **Varnish** load balancer is supplemented with **NGINX** server as HTTPS proxy
- **Scalable NGINX PHP** application servers with preconfigured [automatic horizontal scaling](https://docs.jelastic.com/automatic-horizontal-scaling) to handle load spikes
- [**MariaDB Cluster**](https://github.com/jelastic-jps/mysql-cluster) with asynchronous master-slave replication to ensure high availability, fault tolerance and data security
- **Redis Sessions** node to retain user session parameters
- **Redis Cache** node for content cache storing
- [**Elastic Data Storage**](https://docs.jelastic.com/data-storage-container) node for media files
